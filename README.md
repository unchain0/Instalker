# üì∏ Instalker

**Instalker** is a project that automates the download of Instagram profiles, leveraging
the `instaloader` library for efficient and organized data collection.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings

Some considerations and recommendations when using this project.

1. I don't recommend having more than 200 targets, due to Instagram's own limitations;
2. Downloading highlights slows down downloads a LOT, especially if you have a large list of users;
3. There's no problem using your main Instagram account, I've been using mine for a few months now and the most that's happened is a few warnings where I had to solve a captcha to unlock the account.
    3.1 If you use a recent account (no followers, no following, etc...) it can be blocked quickly by Instagram, but after a while you can recover it.
4. I don't recommend downloading `tagged` on a large list of users, making it impossible to use the bot for a few hours, after which it returns to normal.
